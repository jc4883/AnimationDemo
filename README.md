# AnimationDemo

Background 
  - I wanted to practice CSS animations and learn how to embed them to my websites.

MVP	
  - showcase CSS skills through 3 unique examples: 
    - A dropdown menu that showcases animations and transitions
    - A hover effect that showcases SCSS tricks and syntax.
    - A scroll effect that unfolds an animation when the user scrolls down.
  
Wireframe
  - https://wireframe.cc/FUupyO
  
Technologies 
  - vanilla javascript, SCSS, html
 
Possible Pitfalls
  - I suspect that I may run into some trouble embedding three js onto the webpage.
  - Other than that, I am ready to delve into the physics.
